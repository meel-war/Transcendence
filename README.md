## Technical Stack

### Frontend

- React 19.
- TypeScript.
- Vite.
- React Router.
- Socket.IO client.
- Tailwind CSS / utility-based styling.
- shadcn/radix-ui inspired UI components.
- lucide-react icons.
- sonner notifications.

Why:

- React and TypeScript provide a structured component-based frontend with type safety.
- Vite gives fast development builds.
- Socket.IO client is used for real-time social and game communication.
- A custom design system keeps the interface consistent across pages.

### Backend

- NestJS.
- TypeScript.
- Socket.IO through `@nestjs/websockets` and `@nestjs/platform-socket.io`.
- Prisma ORM.
- PostgreSQL.
- JWT authentication through `@nestjs/jwt`.
- Cookie-based auth with `cookie-parser`.
- class-validator / class-transformer for DTO validation.
- TensorFlow toxicity model for content moderation.
- otplib / qrcode for 2FA.

Why:

- NestJS provides a clear structure with modules, controllers, services, guards, and gateways.
- Prisma provides typed database access and migrations.
- PostgreSQL is reliable for relational data such as users, friendships, messages, matches, guesses, and rewards.
- Socket.IO is used because the project requires real-time interactions.
- HTTP-only cookies are used for JWT storage to reduce exposure to frontend JavaScript.

### Infrastructure

- Docker and Docker Compose.
- Nginx reverse proxy.
- PostgreSQL container.

Why:

- Docker makes the project easier to run consistently across machines.
- Nginx provides a single gateway for frontend/backend/socket routing.

## Instructions

### Prerequisites

Required software:

- Docker and Docker Compose.
- Node.js and npm, if running services manually outside Docker.
- Git.

Recommended versions:

- Node.js: use a recent LTS version if running outside Docker.
- Docker Compose v2 (`docker compose`, not necessarily legacy `docker-compose`).

### Environment setup

Create `backend/.env` from `backend/env.example`.

Example:

```env
DATABASE_URL="prisma+postgres://localhost:676767/?api_key=42dle"
POSTGRES_USER=admin_user
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password
POSTGRES_DB=my_db
JWT_SECRET=change_this_secret
FRONTEND_URL=https://localhost:5173
FORTYTWO_CLIENT_ID=<your_42_client_id>
FORTYTWO_CLIENT_SECRET=<your_42_client_secret>
FORTYTWO_CALLBACK_URL=https://localhost:3000/api/auth/42/callback
```

Notes:

- `JWT_SECRET` must be changed for any real deployment.
- 42 OAuth requires valid credentials from the 42 API.
- The exact URLs may differ depending on whether the app is accessed through Vite directly or the Nginx gateway.

### Run with Docker

From the repository root:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Services:

- Frontend: `http://localhost:5173`
- Backend API: `http://localhost:3000/api`
- Gateway: `http://localhost:8080` and HTTPS gateway on `8443` if configured.
- PostgreSQL: `localhost:5432`

### Prisma setup

When the backend container starts, migrations and seed may be run depending on the Dockerfile/start script.

If running locally or debugging Prisma manually:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npx prisma generate
npx prisma migrate dev
```

To inspect the database:

```bash
cd backend
npx prisma studio
```

### Manual local development

Backend:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run start:dev
```

Frontend:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Build checks:

```bash
cd backend
npm run build
```

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
```

### Useful test endpoints

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health
curl http://localhost:3000/api/champions/names
```

Login/register examples depend on the current database state and should be tested through the frontend or with `curl` using JSON payloads.

## Usage Overview

1. Create an account or log in with 42 OAuth.
2. Complete optional security/profile settings.
3. Add another user as a friend.
4. Accept the friend request from the other account.
5. Open the global chat.
6. Send private messages in real time.
7. Invite a friend to a ranked game from chat or the ranked lobby.
8. Play the multiplayer guessing match.
9. Check profile, leaderboard, match history, and gamification progress.

  - Created and polished all primary application views: `HomePage`, `LoginPage`, `RegisterPage`, `settingsPage`, `ProfilePage`, `FriendsList`, `MatchHistoryPage`, `LeaderboardPage`, and game interfaces (`ClassicGamePage`, `InfiniteGamePage`, `RankedGamePage`, `CountrydlePage`, `RankedLobbyPage`).
  - Integrated the visual structure of the real-time global chat (`GlobalChat.tsx`), including game invitation modals, user profile shortcuts, and typing indicators.
  - Implemented the `Sonner` toast notification system (`Toaster` in `Layout.tsx`), replacing static/native alerts with elegant floating notifications, configuring single-toast queues (`visibleToasts={1}`) and duration controls (`duration={4000}`).
- **Avatar Management System**:
  - Built the `AvatarPicker.tsx` modal in user settings allowing three flexible input methods: picking from a local gallery of default gaming avatars (`DEFAULT_AVATARS`), pasting a direct web image link, or uploading a local image file via `FileReader` base64 encoding.
  - Configured `<AvatarFallback>` to display the first letter of the user's username inside a stylized badge whenever an avatar is unassigned (`null`) or fails to load.
- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Frontend Integration**:
  - Built the complete 2FA management interface in `settingsPage.tsx` and `two-factor.api.ts`.
  - Implemented the QR Code generation modal (`generateTwoFactorQrCode`), the initial 6-digit TOTP verification (`turnOnTwoFactor`), and the secure deactivation modal (`turnOffTwoFactor`).
  - Integrated the two-step login verification challenge in `LoginPage.tsx`: intercepting `{ requires2FA: true }` from the backend login response, dynamically rendering the Google Authenticator 6-digit input form, and calling `/2fa/authenticate` to finalize session cookie issuance.
- **Responsive Layouts & Cross-Browser Compatibility**:
  - Applied adaptive CSS grid and flexbox rules (`grid-cols-3 sm:grid-cols-4 md:grid-cols-5...`) to guarantee seamless navigation across all device screen sizes.
  - Tested, debugged, and verified cross-browser visual consistency and behavior across Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox.

Challenges:

- Maintaining visual consistency across complex real-time states (chat, matchmaking, 2FA modals, and game boards) while keeping the UI responsive.
- Handling 2FA login state transitions smoothly without refreshing or losing user input when switching between email/password and TOTP verification screens.
- Managing various avatar formats (base64 uploads, external URLs, and local defaults) while preventing layout shifts or broken image icons.

How they were addressed:

- Standardized all UI building blocks through Radix UI and Tailwind utility tokens (`cn()`, `cva()`), avoiding ad-hoc inline styles.
- Built clean state transitions in `LoginPage.tsx` (`requires2FA` boolean state) to swap views instantly while keeping the temporary user ID (`tempUserId`) securely in memory.
- Combined Radix UI `<AvatarImage>` with `<AvatarFallback>` to ensure a seamless, professional fallback to the user's initial (`username.charAt(0).toUpperCase()`) whenever an image asset is missing.

### Murad

Main areas:

- Remote authentication with the 42 OAuth API.
- Gamification with XP, levels, daily rewards, streaks, and badges.
- Ranked statistics, Elo updates, and leaderboard.
- Match history frontend integration.
- Internationalization in French, English, and Russian.
- Countrydle game mode and country data.
- Secured public API for LolDle champion data.

Detailed contribution:

- **42 OAuth Authentication**:
  - Implemented the backend authorization and callback flow with the 42 API.
  - Exchanged the authorization code for a 42 access token and retrieved the authenticated user's profile.
  - Added lookup and creation of OAuth users with their 42 identifier, email, username, and avatar.
  - Prevented an OAuth account from silently replacing an existing local account with the same email.
  - Connected the frontend 42 callback page to session recovery after a successful OAuth login.
- **Gamification System**:
  - Created the gamification module, service, controller, and frontend API integration.
  - Implemented daily win rewards with XP based on the number of attempts.
  - Added consecutive-day streak tracking, best streak preservation, and streak bonuses.
  - Implemented automatic level calculation and exposed gamification statistics on user profiles.
  - Integrated rewards into the daily champion game flow and added badge progress to the profile interface.
- **Ranked Statistics & Leaderboard**:
  - Implemented Elo updates for multiplayer victories, defeats, and draws.
  - Updated ranked win/loss counters when a ranked match is resolved.
  - Added a top-10 leaderboard endpoint ordered by Elo and connected it to the leaderboard page.
- **Match History**:
  - Connected the authenticated match-history API to the frontend.
  - Displayed the opponent, result, Elo variation, avatar, and localized match date for each ranked game.
- **Internationalization**:
  - Built the typed React language context and translation lookup system.
  - Added French, English, and Russian translations across navigation, authentication, profiles, social features, game pages, settings, leaderboard, and match history.
  - Persisted the selected language in browser local storage and integrated the language selector into the main layout.
- **Countrydle**:
  - Implemented the country guessing mode with country suggestions, duplicate-guess prevention, comparison feedback, and victory handling.
  - Added the country API integration, daily country match logic, Prisma models/migration, and country seed data.
- **Public API**:
  - Created an independent `PublicApiModule` for external access to LolDle champion data.
  - Added secured API-key authentication that stays separate from JWT/cookie authentication.
  - Added separate read and write API permissions so destructive actions require the write key.
  - Implemented public CRUD endpoints for champions with DTO validation and safe public field selection.
  - Added rate limiting for public API requests and documented usage in `docs/public-api.md`.

Challenges:

- Linking an external OAuth identity to the local user model without exposing tokens or creating duplicate accounts.
- Keeping XP, streak, Elo, and ranked statistics consistent when several game modes update user data.
- Maintaining complete and type-safe translations across a growing number of pages and reusable components.
- Representing country attributes consistently between seed data, backend comparisons, API types, and the frontend grid.

How they were addressed:

- Kept the OAuth code exchange and 42 profile request on the backend, then reused the existing JWT cookie session flow.
- Centralized rewards and Elo calculations in `GamificationService` and used Prisma transactions for paired ranked updates.
- Used a single typed translation catalogue and `LanguageContext` so missing keys are detected instead of silently falling back.
- Shared typed API structures and reusable game components for Countrydle suggestions, guesses, history, and victory states.

## Security Notes

- The frontend is not trusted for authorization.
- The backend checks authenticated user identity using JWT/cookies.
- HTTP routes use guards such as `JwtAuthGuard`.
- Socket gateways authenticate connections during the handshake.
- Chat and game actions use backend services to enforce rules.
- Sensitive fields such as `password_hash` and 2FA secrets should never be returned to the frontend.
- HTTP-only cookies reduce direct token exposure to frontend JavaScript.
